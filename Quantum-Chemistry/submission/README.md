# Metallo-Polyelectrolyte-Gels - Submission
To perform a quantum chemistry calculation, one can run the `example.sh` file:
```bash
source example.sh
```
This will create a new folder `data` where the results will be stored. To see what system is being simulated, examine the files within `input`. In this example, a sodium-acetate complex is being simulated with implicit water (see `input/implicit_water_sodium.sh`).
