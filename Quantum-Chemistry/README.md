# Metallo-Polyelectrolyte-Gels - Quantum Chemistry
This section of the repository contains all the codes needed to obtain the results obtained from quantum chemistry calculations (binding energies and simulated FTIR-spectra). The folders are divided as follows:
* `scripts`: contains the methods and parameters used to perform the quantum chemistry calculations. They are intended to be modular enough to simulate any metal-ligand system within ORCA.
* `software`: contains the scripts needed to install the various packages used within the quantum chemistry calculations.
* `submission`: contains the submission scripts where users can specify the settings of the system they desire to simulate.
