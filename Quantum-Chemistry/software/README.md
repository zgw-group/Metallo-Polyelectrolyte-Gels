# Metallo-Polyelectrolyte-Gels - Quantum Chemistry Software
In this folder, we provide all the scripts needed to install the packages used to perform the quantum chemistry calculations:
* ORCA (v5.0.2)
* MolSimplify
* Multiwfn (v3.8)
Note that, to install ORCA, one needs to download the tarball from the [ORCA forum](https://orcaforum.kofo.mpg.de/app.php/portal)
