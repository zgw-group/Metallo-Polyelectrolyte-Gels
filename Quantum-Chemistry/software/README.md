# Metallo-Polyelectrolyte-Gels - Quantum Chemistry Software
In this folder, we provide all the scripts needed to install the packages used to perform the quantum chemistry calculations:
* ORCA (v5.0.2): Performs the quantum chemistry calculations
* MolSimplify: Generates the initial metal complex structures.
* Multiwfn (v3.8): Analyses the results from ORCA to generate simulated FTIR spectra.

Note that, to install ORCA, one needs to download the tarball from the [ORCA forum](https://orcaforum.kofo.mpg.de/app.php/portal).
