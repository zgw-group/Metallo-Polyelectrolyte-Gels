# Metallo-Polyelectrolyte-Gels - Molecular Dynamics
This section of the repository contains all the codes needed to obtain the results obtained from molecular dynamics simulations (relaxation times, stress-strain curves, cluster sizes, crosslinking fractions). The folders are divided as follows:
* `scripts`: contains the methods and parameters used to perform the molecular dynamics simulations. They are intended to be modular such that any Kremer-Grest polyelectrolyte system can be simulated.
* `software`: contains the scripts needed to install the various packages used within the molecular dynamics simulations.
* `submission`: contains the submission scripts where users can specify the settings of the system they desire to simulate.
