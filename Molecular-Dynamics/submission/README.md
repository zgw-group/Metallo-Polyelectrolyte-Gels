# Metallo-Polyelectrolyte-Gels - Submission
To perform the molecular dynamics simulations, one can run the `example.sh` file:
```bash
source example.sh
```
This will create a new folder `data` where the results will be stored. To see what system is being simulated, examine the files within `input`. In this example, a divalent MPEC gel is being simulated (see `input/divalent_mpec_gel.sh`).
