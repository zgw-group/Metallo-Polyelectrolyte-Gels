# Metallo-Polyelectrolyte-Gels
This repository contains all the codes required to obtain the results given in _'Molecular Control via Dynamic Bonding Enables Material Responsiveness in Additively Manufactured Metallo-Polyelectrolytes'_ by S. Lee, P. Walker _et al._. The repository is divided into three independent sections:
* Mean-Field-Theory: Contains the codes needed to generate the phase diagrams obtained using a novel mean-field theory using Clapeyron.
* Molecular-Dynamics: Contains the codes needed to perform the Kremer-Grest Molecular-Dynamics Simulations using LAMMPS.
* Quantum-Chemistry: Contains the codes needed to perform the Density-Functional Theory Calculations using ORCA.
